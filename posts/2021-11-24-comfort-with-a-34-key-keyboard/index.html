However, when I tested the keyboard, some keys were not working so I asked around in the Low Profile Keyboards discord group and Pierrec (the creator of the ferris) told me it was likely that some MCU pins were not soldered properly, he offered to fix it for me, but I decided to give it a shot and it turned out well, the keyboard works flawlessly now.\nThe one thing that is special about the ferris is that it has column stagger, meaning each column of keys are shifted to different offsets to better match natural finger alignment.

<p>My current keyboard is the <a href=https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris>Ferris v0.2</a>. I&rsquo;ve been
using it for about 6 months now and it feels very much like my endgame keyboard. Before I go onto to

<p>This was the first keyboard I bought, it&rsquo;s a full sized keyboard, back then having more keys at my disposal seemed like a good idea.</p>

</p>
<p>Based on the experience above, I concluded for a keyboard to be comfortable it has to fit these criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>A split keyboard</li>
<li>Ortholinear</li>
<li>Low Profile/High Profile with wrist rest</li>
<li>Small size to minimize finger travel</li>
